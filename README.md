# Installation

```bash
npm install --global @lpezet/etl-js-cli
```

# Features

* Template-based process using YML to express steps and activities as part of ETL
* Built-in modules to leverage already installed software (e.g. mysql, mysqlimport, etc.)
* Dynamic behavior through the use of *tags* in activities.

# Concept

This command line tool lets you tap into the power of [ETL-JS](https://github.com/lpezet/etl-js).
The idea is to be able to share and easily repeat activities, and leverage existing tools as much as possible.

Steps and activities are basically specified in YML like so:

```yml
etlSets:
 default:
  - activity1
  - activity2
 somethingelse:
  - activity3

activity1:
 commands:
  my_command:
   command: echo "Hello..."

activity2:
 commands:
  something:
   command: echo "World!"

activity3:
 commands:
  bye_bye:
   command: echo "Bye bye!"
```

For more details, have a look at [ETL-JS](https://github.com/lpezet/etl-js).
